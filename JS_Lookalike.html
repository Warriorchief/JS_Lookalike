           <h1>Javascript Basics</h1>
           <p> Javascript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
             Javascript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a
             small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers
             to take it in a bunch of different directions. Javascript lives inside
             a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected
             to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control
             over them. </p>
           <ul>
             <li> <a href="url">Variable Declaration</a> Javascript variables
               are containers for storing data value -- imagine a cup you fill
               with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, the variable holds the value.
               All Javascript variables must be identified with unique names. These
               unique values are called identifiers.<span class="purp"> var x;</span></li>
             <li><a href="url">Variable Assignment</a>Assignment operators assign
               values to Javascript variables -- our cup can now have coffee
               poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = operator
               assigns a value to a variable.<span class="purp">var x=10;</span></li>
            <li><a href="url">Data Types</a>Date types are an important concept;
              to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type.
              There are six data types that are Javascript primitives: Boolean
              <span class="purp">true</span> or <span class="purp">false</span>; null
              <span class="purp">null</span>--aka nothing; Number--<span class="purp">
                42</span> or <span class="purp">3.14159</span>;String--<span class="purp">
                "Coding Dojo Rocks";</span>Array--<span class="purp">['1','Coding'
                '2','Dojo'];</span>and Object -- <span class="purp">{first_name: "Jane",
                last_name: "Doe"}</span></li>
            <li><a href="url">Conditionals</a>When you write code, you want to perform
              different actions for different decisions -- hitting different code
              blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use
              conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the
              following conditional statements: <span class="purp">if</span> a specified
              condition is true, do this code in our block; <span class="purp">else if
              </span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition
              is false; <span class="purp">else</span> we execute this block of code.</li>
            <li><a href="url">Loops</a>There are many different kinds of loops in
            every programming language, but they all do essentially the same thing:
            they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a
            mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's
            a loop!</li>
            <li><a href="url">Function</a> Functions are an emcapsulation of a code
            block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think
            of it as a list of instructions. As an exmaple imagine we are putting
            together a desk from Ikea, we can open up the instruction manual and get
            started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the tabletop
            right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more
          tables to do so let's call our function over and over and over.</li>
